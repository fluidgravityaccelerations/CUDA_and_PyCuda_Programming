# CUDA and PyCuda Programming

## CUDA Array Sum Example (Simple_CUDA_Google_Colab.ipynb)

The file contains a simple example of a **CUDA program** that performs element-wise array summation on the GPU. The example is implemented as a **Google Colab Jupyter notebook**, demonstrating how to compile and run CUDA code directly within the Colab environment. It serves as a minimal reference for learning how to allocate memory on the GPU, launch kernels, and manage CUDA error checking.

## PyCUDA Vector Addition Example

Example demonstrating how to execute a **CUDA kernel** from within a **Google Colab** environment using **PyCUDA**. The code performs the **elementwise summation of two vectors** on the GPU.

The implementation is based on the compilation and execution of a custom CUDA kernel through `SourceModule`
