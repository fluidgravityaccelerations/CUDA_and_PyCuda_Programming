# CUDA and PyCuda Programming

## CUDA Array Sum Example

The file contains a simple example of a **CUDA program** that performs element-wise array summation on the GPU. The example is implemented as a **Google Colab Jupyter notebook**, demonstrating how to compile and run CUDA code directly within the Colab environment. It serves as a minimal reference for learning how to allocate memory on the GPU, launch kernels, and manage CUDA error checking.
